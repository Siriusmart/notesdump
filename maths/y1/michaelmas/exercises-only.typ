== Example 1: Aeroplane flight path

An aeroplane wishes to fly from city A to city B, which is at a 
distance of 1000 km north-west of A. There is a wind of speed 
$w = 50"km" "hr"^(-1)$  from the south-west, and the average speed of the 
plane relative to the air is 
$v = 800 "km" "hr"^(-1)$. What direction would the 
pilot fly in, and how long does the journey take?

== Example 2: Angle between lines

Use the cosine rule to calculate the angle between the lines $arrow(O A)$
and $arrow(O B)$, where $O$ is the origin, $a = (1,2,3)$
and $b = (2,3,2)$.

== Example 3: Straight line through two points

Find the equation of the straight line through the points $a= (1,2,3)$
, $b = (4,0,6)$. Does this line pass through the point 
$c = (4,0,0)$? For 
what value of $mu$ does the point $(10,4, mu)$ lie on the line?

== Example 4: Centroid of a triangle

Consider the triangle $A B C$ , with the position vectors of the points 
relative to the origin $O$  being $bold(a) ,bold(b) ,bold(c)$ respectively. Show that the 
medians (the lines from each vertex to the middle of the opposite 
side) meet in a single point, the so-called centroid (cf. question 9 on 
Example Sheet 1).

== Example 5: Angle from dot product 

Find the acute angle between the vectors $(5,0,3)$
 and $(1,3,4)$.

== Example 6: Vector component in a direction

Find the component of the vector $(2,1,7)$
 in the direction $(1,1,1)$.

== Example 7: Plane passing through three points 
Find the equation of the plane which passes through the points 
$(1,0,0)$,
 $(2,1,0)$
 and $(1,1,1)$
. What is the minimum distance of this 
plane from the origin?

== Example 8: Intersection of two planes 

Find the line of intersection of the two planes with normals parallel 
to the vectors $(1,0,2)$
 and $(1,1,1)$
, respectively, which both pass 
through the point $(1,1,0)$
. What angles does this line make with the 
coordinate axes?

== Example 9: Visibility over a wall

Can an observer $A$ at $(4,5,1)$ see object at the point $B$ at $(2,3,3/2)$
when there is an intervening wall with top given by the line  
$
bold(r) = (1,2,1) + lambda(1,-1,-1)
$
[the $z$ axis is the upward vertical]?

== Example 10: Calculate vector product 

Calculate 
$a and b$  when $a=(1,2,3)$
 and $b=(4,5,6)$.
